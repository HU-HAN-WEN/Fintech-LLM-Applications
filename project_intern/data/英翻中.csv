Two private companies announced Friday a partnership to release mosquitoes across the Caribbean bred with a bacterium that blocks the dengue virus as the region fights a record number of cases.
Orbit Services Partners Inc., a company registered in Barbados, is partnering with Verily, a San Francisco-based health technology company, for the project. Similar projects using the Wolbachia bacterium already have been implemented elsewhere in the world.
Mosquitoes are infected with Wolbachia in a laboratory and then released into the wild, where they pass it on to their offspring. The bacterium prevents the dengue virus from replicating inside a mosquito’s gut.
The Caribbean, along with the Americas, has reported more than 4 million dengue cases so far this year, the highest number since record-keeping began in 1980.","在加勒比地區登革熱病例創下新高之際，兩家私人公司週五宣布建立合作關係，在整個加勒比地區釋放用一種能阻斷登革熱病毒之細菌所培育的蚊子。
